The act of collecting comes with many benefits â€“ relaxation, stress reduction, sense of pride, sense of community. Some articles even suggest that it helps build your organisational and observational skills. In the United States, a study found that 42% of millennials and 37% of Gen Xers collect physical items as a hobby or investment in 2021.

Introducing collectify, a **dedicated cross-platform app** that helps collectors track, build up and showcase their collections. **No news, no articles, no fluff. Only collections.**

Users can display their collections in a variety of categories, and view the galleries of like-minded collectors. They can also initiate trades (or simply strike up a conversation) using collectify's integrated chat. 

This app aims to bring together communities of collectors worldwide and provide an easy way for them to show off their prized collections while appreciating similar collections that others have built up.
